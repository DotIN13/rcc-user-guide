# Introduction to RCC for MSc in Analytics

As a student in the Master of Science in Analytics (MScA) Program, you will be able to make use of The University of Chicago’s Research Computing Center (RCC) resources in completing your capstone project.  Some courses in the program will also make use of RCC resources.

RCC provides high-end research computing resources to researchers at the University of Chicago. These resources include centrally managed high-performance computing, storage, and visualization hardware, software, scientific and technical user support, as well as education and training opportunities to help researchers effectively make use of modern HPC technology.
