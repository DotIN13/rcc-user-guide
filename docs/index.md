# RCC User Guide

## How to use this guide 

This user guide provides information on accessing and making use of RCC resources. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you navigate through it:    
- You will see **this icon** <img src="img/copy-icon.png" width="30" height="30" /> in the top-right of grey code blocks, which will allow you to copy the contents of the block to your clipboard, for easy code transfer.   
-  The **search bar** in the top right can help finding the right information simple and quick (e.g., search: "GPU")  
- If you find any content that you think should be changed or improved (typo, out-of-date, etc.), please feel free to (1) clone and edit the guide's [markdown source](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/user-guide) directly and submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), (2) create an [Issue](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/user-guide/issues/new) on GitHub, or (3) email help@rcc.uchicago.edu
