## Overview of RCC's HPC Systems
The following table provides a high-level summary of the various high-performance computing (HPC) systems that the RCC houses. While our flagship system for scientific computing is Midway3, offering state-of-the art CPU and GPU nodes, we also offer several other specialized HPC systems to meet users' needs.
