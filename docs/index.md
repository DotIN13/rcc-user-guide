## Where to start?

* Researchers interested in using the RCC systems can [request an account](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/accounts-allocations/request-account){:target="_blank"}.  
* For Service Units (computing time) and storage resources, [request an allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/accounts-allocations/request-allocation){:target="_blank"}.  
* If you would like to chat with an RCC specialist about what services are best for you, please [contact our Help Desk](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/consulting-and-technical-support).

!!! tip "Know what you're looking for?"
    Check out the search bar in the top right of the page (e.g., search: "GPU")--it's suprisingly useful!
