# ThinLinc - Remote desktop 
## Connecting with ThinLinc
ThinLinc is a remote desktop server used to connect to RCC clusters and obtain a remote graphical user interface (GUI). We recommend using ThinLinc to use software that requires a GUI. Remember, ThinLinc is much less stable than SSH. 

There are two methods to access ThinLinc on RCC clusters:
1. Through a web browser
2. Using the ThinLinc app. 

### Accessing ThinLinc through a web browser   
Point your web browser to the following web address: 
=== "Midway2"
    ```
    https://midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu.
    ```
    You will land on this page:
    <p align="center">
	<img src="../img/connecting/midway2_thinlinc_web.png" width="300" />
	</p> 
===+ "Midway3"
    ```
    https://midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu.
    ```
    You will land on this page:
    <p align="center">
	<img src="../img/connecting/midway3_thinlinc_web.png" width="300" />
	</p> 

Proceed to log in with your CNetID and password.

Duo two-factor authentication will request you select from the 2FA options to authenticate.


### ThinLinc Desktop Client
Download and install the appropriate ThinLinc client [here](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download). 

Open the ThinLinc client (app) and use the following information to set up your connection to Midway:

=== "Midway2"
    ```
    Server: midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu
    Username: CNetID
    Password: CNetID password
    ```
    Your client should look similar to this:
    ![Midway 2 ThinLinc Client](img/connecting/midway2_thinlinc_client.png){ width=500 }

===+ "Midway3"
    ```
    Server: midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu
    Username: CNetID
    Password: CNetID password
    ```
    Your client should look similar to this:
    ![Midway 3 ThinLinc Client](img/connecting/midway3_thinlinc_client.png){ width=500 }
    

ThinLinc will default to open in a fullscreen window that fills `all monitors`. To change this, use `Options` from the initial login interface. 

After clicking the `Connect` button, Duo two-factor autentication will request you select from the available 2FA options to authenticate to Midway.

```
Duo two-factor authentication for user

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

1) receive a push code on your Duo app,
2) Receive authentication through your phone number, and
3) get an SMS code.

Passcode or option (1-3):
```

## The ThinLinc Interface

Upon successfully logging in via ThinLinc, you will be connected to a login node and presented with a desktop interface. Select Applications tab in the top left corner to access the terminal, file browser, and other utilities.

To view all available applications, click the 3x3 dot grid on the bottom of the Activties Tab:

![ThinLinc Apps](img/connecting/thinlinc_apps.jpeg){ width=700 }

To copy/paste text between your computer and ThinLinc (when copying code into the Terminal, for example), open the side toolbar by clicking the small blue handle. Click the Clipboard icon. The text field that just open will be synced with the clipboard on the server, so you can copy and paste to and from this text field.

With ThinLinc it is possible to maintain an active session after you have closed your connection to Midway. To disconnect from Midway but maintain an active session, simply close the ThinLinc window. **You must have "End existing session" unchecked for this to occur.**

To exit ThinLinc and terminate your session completely, simply exit or close the ThinLinc application.

## Remote Visualization on Midway2

RCC provides a mechanism for accessing a GPU-equipped visualization node, which can be used for running 3D and graphics-intensive visualization software packages. 

First log into Midway via ThinLinc.

Once logged in, open a terminal and in the terminal window, issue the command `sviz`

![sviz terminal](img/connecting/sviz-terminal.png){ width=500 }

To exit the Visualization node, simply close the terminal window from which it was launched. You can then log out of Midway by selecting Logout from the Applications menu in ThinLinc, or by simply closing the ThinLinc window.

## Login nodes vs. Compute nodes

Once you have connected to Midway2 or Midway3 (see [Connecting to Midway](midway_connecting.md)), you may work on one of the login nodes. Login nodes may be used for compiling and debugging code, installing software, editing and managing files, submitting jobs, or any other work that is *not* long-running or computationally intensive. *Login nodes should never be used for computationally intensive work.*

All intensive computations should be performed on compute nodes. If you are unsure whether your computations will be intensive, please [request an interactive session](midway_submitting_jobs.md#interactive-jobs) and continue your work once you have connected to the compute node.

!!! warning
    Running computationally intensive jobs on the login nodes prevents other users from efficiently using the cluster. RCC System Administrators may terminate your processes without warning if your processes disrupt other usersâ€™ work on the RCC cluster.
