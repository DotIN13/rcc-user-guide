# Data Storage

RCC provides a high-performance GPFS shared file system which is used for usersâ€™ home directories,
shared project spaces, and high-throughput scratch space.  All compute nodes are diskless.

In addition to high-performance GPFS file system, RCC also offers Cost-effective Data Storage (CDS) through
[Cluster Partnership Program](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/cluster-partnership-program) for long-term data storage. CDS is only available from login nodes and is meant
to be used as a storage for less frequently used data. Before performing any computation on the data stored
on CDS, it first needs to be copied to the GPFS file system.

## Quotas

The amount of data that can be stored in home directories, project directories, and shared scratch directories is controlled by quota. RCC enforces hard and soft limits on quotas. A soft quota can be exceeded for a short period of time called a grace period.  The hard quota cannot be exceeded under any circumstances.

Additional storage is available through the [Cluster Partnership Program](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/cluster-partnership-program),
a [Research I Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/research-allocation-request), [Research II Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/research-allocation-request-II) or, in certain circumstances,
a [Special Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/special-allocation-request).

### Checking available space

To check your current quotas use the `quota` command. Typical output may look like this



![image](./img/quota.png)

The output could have up to three sections. The top section displays information about the home directory and the scratch space (scratch2). The middle section currently displays information about the project space. Depending on how many groups you are part of, you may see multiple lines in the middle and the bottom sections.

Descriptions of the fields:


### fileset()
This is the file set or file system where this quota is valid.


### type()
This is the type of quota. This can be *blocks* for the amount of consumed disk space or *files* for the
number of files
in a directory. Either of blocks or files quotas can be set at the user or group level. The quota on the
home directory and the scratch space is set as per user basis and the quota on the scratch space is set as per
group basis.


### used()
This is the amount of disk space consumed or the number of files in the specified location.


### quota()
This is the *soft quota* (storage space or file count) associated with the specified location. It is
possible for usage to exceed the soft quota for the grace period or up to the hard limit.


### limit()
This is the *hard quota* (storage space or file count) associated with the specified location. When your
usage exceeds this limit, you will NOT be able to write to that filesystem.


### grace()
This is the grace period, or the amount of time remaining that
the soft quota can be exceeded.
The value *none* means that the quota is not exceeded. After a soft quota
has been exceeded for longer than the grace period, it will no longer
be possible to create new files.

## Persistent Space

Persistent space is appropriate for long term storage. The two locations for persistent space are the home and project directories. The home and project directories have both file system Snapshots and tape backup for data protection.

### Home Directories

Every RCC user has a home directory located at `/home/<CNetID>`. The `HOME` environment variable points to this location. The home directory is accessible from all RCC compute systems and is generally used for storing frequently used items such as source code, binaries, and scripts. By default, a home directory is only accessible by its owner (mode `0700`) and is suitable for storing files which do not need to be shared with others.

### Project Directories

All RCC PI Groups are allocated a Project Directory located at `/project/<PI CNetID>` or
`/project2/<PI CNetID>` where *<PI CNetID>* is the CNetID of your RCC PI account holder. These directories
are accessible by all members of the PI Group and are generally used for storing
files which need to be shared by members of the group. Additional storage in project directories is available
through the [Cluster Partnership Program](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/cluster-partnership-program), a [Research I Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/research-allocation-request) or [Research II Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/research-allocation-request-II) or,
in certain circumstances, a [Special Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/special-allocation-request).

The default permissions for files
and directories created in a project directory allow group read/write with the
group sticky bit set (mode `2770`). The group ownership is set to the PI group.

## Scratch Space

### Shared Scratch Space

High performance shared scratch space can be accessed using the SCRATCH environment variable. This scratch space is intended to be used for reading or writing data required by jobs running on the cluster. **If a user is over quota, s/he can use scratch space as a temporary location to hold files (and/or compress them for archival purposes) but as scratch space is neither snapshotted nor backed up, it should always be viewed as temporary.**

**NOTE**: It is the responsibility of the user to ensure any important data in
scratch space is moved to persistent storage.  Scratch space is meant to be used for temporary, short-term  storage only.

The default permissions for scratch space allow access only by its owner (mode `0700`). The standard quota
for the high performance scratch directory is 5 TB with a 100GB soft limit.  The grace period that the soft limit may be
exceeded is 30 days for shared scratch space.

## Data Recovery and Backups

### Snapshots

Automated snapshots of home and project directories are available in case
of accidental file deletion or other problems. Currently snapshots are
available for these time periods:

<!-- * 4 hourly snapshots -->
<!-- * 7 daily snapshots -->
<!-- * 4 weekly snapshots -->
| Directory| Snapshot kept| Snapshot Path|
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `$HOME`| 7 daily and 2 weekly| `/snapshots/home/SNAPSHOT/home/CNetID`|
| `/project/<any_folder>`| 7 daily and 2 weekly| `/snapshots/project/SNAPSHOT/project/<any_folder>`|
| `/project2/<any_folder>`| 7 daily and 4 weekly| `/snapshots/project2/SNAPSHOT/project2/<any_folder>`|

The snapshots for the `home` and `project` directories are available from the login nodes. The {SNAPSHOT} refers to the time of the backup, e.g. daily-YYYY-MM-DD.05h30 or weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.05h30. To view the available snapshots of the `home` directory, for example, use the command `ls /snapshots/home`

To restore a file from a snapshot, simply copy the file to where you want it with either `cp` or `rsync`.
