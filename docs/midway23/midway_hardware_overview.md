### Operating System and Connectivity

Midway3 runs CentOs X, and all nodes are connected via Infiniband.

### Standard Compute Nodes Nodes

* XXX compute nodes, each equipped with:
    * 4 Intel Cascade Lake CPUs (xxx cores)
    * XX Local SSD Storage 
    * XX Memory 
* XX AMD compute nodes, with same specification, except 

### Specialized Nodes

#### GPU Nodes
There are 11 GPU nodes that are part of the Midway3 communal resources. Each GPU node has the Standard Intel Compute Node specifications and the following GPU configurations:

- 5 GPU nodes w/ 4x NVIDIA V100 GPUs per node
- 5 GPU nodes w/ 4x NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs per node
- 1 GPU node w/ 4x NVIDIA A100 GPUs per node

#### Big Memory Nodes
There are 2 big memory nodes available to all users. The big memory node has the Standard Intel Compute Node specifications, but with the following larger memory configurations:

- 1 nodes w/ 768 GB of memory
- 1 nodes w/ 1.52 TB of memory
