### Operating System and Connectivity

Midway3 runs CentOs 8, and all nodes are connected via HDR InfiniBand (100 Gbps) interconnect.

### Standard Compute Nodes Nodes

* 210 Intel Cascade Lake CPU-only compute nodes, each equipped with:
    * 2x Intel Xeon Gold 6248R (48 cores per node)
    * 960 GB Local SSD Storage 
    * 192 GB Memory 
* 40 AMD compute nodes with same specifications, except AMD EPYC Rome CPUs

### Specialized Nodes

#### GPU Nodes
There are 11 GPU nodes that are part of the Midway3 communal resources. Each GPU node has the Standard Intel Compute Node specifications and the following GPU configurations:

- 5 GPU nodes w/ 4x NVIDIA V100 GPUs per node
- 5 GPU nodes w/ 4x NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs per node
- 1 GPU node w/ 4x NVIDIA A100 GPUs per node

#### Big Memory Nodes
There are 2 big memory nodes available to all users. The big memory node has the Standard Intel Compute Node specifications, but with the following larger memory configurations:

- 1 nodes w/ 768 GB of memory
- 1 nodes w/ 1.52 TB of memory
