# GPU jobs

The `gpu2` partition is dedicated to software that uses Graphical
Processing Units (GPUs). See [Types of Compute Nodes](../../using-midway/index.md#node-types) for technical
specifications of the gpu2 nodes.

CUDA and OpenACC are two widely used tools for developing GPU-based
software. For information on compiling code with CUDA and OpenACC, see
[CUDA and OpenACC Compilers](../../software/compilers/nvidia/index.md#gpu-compiling).

## Running GPU code on Midway2

To submit a job to one of the GPU nodes, you must include the
following lines in your sbatch script:

```bash
#SBATCH --partition=gpu2
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:N
```

where `N` is the number of GPUs  requested. Allowable settings for `N` range from 1 to 4. If your application is entirely GPU
driven, then you do not need to explicilty request cores as one
CPU core will be assigned by default to act as a master to launch
the GPU based calculation. If however your application is mixed
CPU-GPU then you will need to request the number of cores with â€“ntasks
as is required by your job.

Here is an example sbatch script that allocates GPU resources and loads
the CUDA compilers (see also `gpu.sbatch`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=gpu   # job name
#SBATCH --output=gpu.out # output log file
#SBATCH --error=gpu.err  # error file
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00  # 1 hour of wall time
#SBATCH --nodes=1        # 1 GPU node
#SBATCH --partition=gpu2 # GPU2 partition
#SBATCH --ntasks=1       # 1 CPU core to drive GPU
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1     # Request 1 GPU

# Load all required modules below. As an example we load cuda/9.1
module load cuda/9.1

# Add lines here to run your GPU-based computations.

```
