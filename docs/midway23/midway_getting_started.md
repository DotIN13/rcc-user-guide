## What is Midway?
Midway2 and Midway3 are professionally-managed high performance computing clusters that constitute the core of the RCCâ€™s advanced computational infrastructure. Technical details about the systems are available [here](midway_hardware_overview.md).

## Gaining Access
The RCC offers two types of user accounts: a PI Account and a General User Account. All General Users must be sponsored by a PI with an active RCC account. More information about creating an account can be found here (link).

## Connecting and Running Jobs
After your RCC User account is created, you will [connect to Midway](midway_connecting.md). There are several different ways to connect, depending on your operating system and desired user experience. 

Once you successful connect to Midway and move data onto the system, you will be able to begin [submitting and running jobs](midway_jobs_overview.md) (running your programs on the cluster).
