# Getting Started on Midway

## What is Midway?
Midway2 and Midway3 are professionally-managed high performance computing clusters that constitute the core of the RCCâ€™s advanced computational infrastructure. Midway2 was introduced in 2016 as the successor to the RCC's first HPC cluster, Midway. Four years later in 2021, the Midway3 cluster was brought online. In this guide we use "Midway" to refer to both existing clusters, as much of the user experience for Midway2 and Midway3 is similar. We distinguish between the two whenever there are system-specific differences.  

## Gaining Access
The RCC offers two types of user accounts: a PI Account and a General User Account. All General Users must be sponsored by a PI with an active RCC account. More information about creating an account can be found on the [accounts and allocations page](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/accounts-allocations){:target="_blank"}.

## Connecting and Running Jobs
After your RCC User account is created, you will [connect to a Midway login node](midway_connecting.md). There are several different ways to connect, depending on your operating system and desired user experience. Login nodes are the 'foyer' of the Midway supercomputer. They are connected to the internet and enable you to transfer data to and from the system. 

Once you successful connect to Midway and [move data](midway_data_transfer.md) onto the system, you will be able to begin [submitting and running jobs on compute nodes](midway_jobs_overview.md) (running your programs on the cluster).
