This page describes what resources are available from RCC and how to get started accessing and using them.

RCC resources are available to all members of the UChicago community. The RCC can also establish user accounts for collaborators from outside UChicago. 

## Gaining Access
The RCC offers two types of user accounts: a PI Account and a General User Account. All General Users must be sponsored by a PI with an active RCC account. More information about creating an account can be found here (link).

## Hardware
Midway 2 is a professionally-managed high performance computing cluster and forms the second generation core of RCCâ€™s advanced computational infrastructure. Further specifications are available here (link).

Midway 3 is the latest high performance computing (HPC) cluster built, deployed and maintained by RCC. Further specifications are available here (link).

## Connecting
To use resources provided by the Research Computing Center you will need a RCC user account. If you do not already have a RCC acount, see the account management page (link) for more information on obtaining a RCC account.

Your RCC account uses your UChicago CNetID for the username and the corresponding CNetID password for the password.
