# Syncing Globus with UChicago Cloud Storage

**Globus** is a robust file-sharing and transfer service. This page explains how to sync Globus with University of Chicago cloud storage so you can use Globus features, like <a href=‘https://rcc-uchicago.github.io/user-guide/globus-transfer-files/#schedule-a-file-transfer’ target=‘_blank’>scheduled file transfers</a>, with files stored in your UChicago **Box**, **Google Drive**, and **OneDrive** accounts.

Globus calls a collection of files an endpoint. UChicago has Globus endpoints for Box, Google Drive, and OneDrive. By connecting to these endpoints, you can access files stored in your UChicago Box, Google Drive, and OneDrive accounts.

Start by logging into the <a href='https://globus.rcc.uchicago.edu/'>Globus Web App</a> with your CNet ID. Go into the File Manager and search for the endpoint for your cloud platform of choice using the Collection search bar:
