# Data Management FAQ

### How much storage space do I have left/used?
Keep track of your storage usage by logging into Midway clusters and running the `quota` command. This handy tool on the Midway 2 and 3 ecosystems provides you with all the corresponding information you need.

### I'm over quota (expired quota); what do I do?
If you find yourself over quota (expired quota), fret not! Follow these steps to get back on track:

Identify whether your quota is expired due to the number of files (`files`) or total file size (`blocks`). If it's due to the number of files, consider zipping some files to count as one, rather than a large set of small files. If your quota is expired due to file size:

1. If `/home` is expired, move your files to `/scratch` or `/project/drpepper`. Some users may also utilize `/dali/drpepper`, `/beagle3/drpepper`, `/cds/drpepper`, `/cds2/drpepper`, or `/cds3/drpepper`.
2. If `/scratch` is expired, relocate your files to `/project/drpepper`. Similarly, some users may utilize `/dali/drpepper`, `/beagle3/drpepper`, `/cds/drpepper`, `/cds2/drpepper`, or `/cds3/drpepper`. Alternatively, delete unnecessary files.
3. Request your PI to submit a research allocation request to [obtain more storage](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/accounts-allocations/request-allocation). If the standard research allocation is insufficient, consider supplemental research allocation for temporary storage expansion.
4. Ask your PI to purchase additional storage via the [cluster partnership program](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/cluster-partnership-program).

### Why can't I write files into my home directory?
Encountering errors while writing files typically indicates that you're over-quota. Ensure that you're within quota limits in terms of both size and number of files using the `quota` command.

### How do I increase my storage quota?
Expand your storage capacity through the [Cluster Partnership Program](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/cluster-partnership-program). Alternatively, request additional storage as part of a [Research II Allocation or Special Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/accounts-allocations/request-allocation).

### How do I share files with others?
**Option 1: Globus**
Explore the Globus section of this user guide for comprehensive insights into file sharing via Globus.

**Option 2: Advanced access control via ACL**
Refer to the user guide section on `Advanced access control via ACL` for detailed instructions.

**Option 3: Allow them to join your RCC group**
Direct individuals to fill out the form for group access. Keep in mind that this grants access to all your `/project` files and compute resources, making it an all-encompassing choice for file sharing.

### I accidentally deleted or lost a file. How do I restore it?
The most effective method for file recovery involves utilizing snapshots. Navigate through this user guide for details on `snapshots`.

### Unlocking access to files under `/project` for departed users
