Our HPC environment supports popular GeoAI frameworks and libraries, enabling researchers to develop and run sophisticated AI models on geospatial data at scale.

### CyberGIS: Unleashing the Power of Cyberinfrastructure

CyberGIS combines cyberinfrastructure capabilities with GIS to tackle computationally intensive spatial problems. RCC's HPC resources are well-suited for CyberGIS applications, offering:

- **Scalable Processing**: Handle very large spatial datasets and complex analytical software beyond the capabilities of desktop systems.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Enable multiple users to access CyberGIS capabilities and share resources.
- **Advanced Geospatial Tools**: Provide access to cutting-edge spatial analysis techniques optimized for high-performance environments.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Facilitate the synthesis of geospatial approaches with other scientific domains.

## Accessing GIS on HPC

1. **Request an RCC account** if you don't already have one
2. **Connect to the RCC cluster** via SSH or our user-friendly web portal
3. **Load GIS modules** using the `module load` command (e.g., `module load qgis-ltr`)
4. **Execute your GIS workflows** through batch jobs or interactive sessions

## Training and Support

- **Workshops**: RCC-GIS provides complimentary workshops and bootcamp courses on GIS, including specialized workshops on GeoAI and CyberGIS applications every quarter to assist UChicago researchers in addressing location-based data issues. Students, faculty, and staff can sign up through the RCC website. 
- **Documentation**: RCC-GIS offers regularly updated documentation for running various GIS software, including popular tools and specialized applications. 
- **Consultation**: One-on-one support is available for integrating GIS workflows with HPC and advanced GIS technologies. If you have specific questions about how GIS can assist with your research project or need guidance on getting started, please contact the RCC-GIS team.

## Data Management

- Access to shared geospatial datasets on RCC storage systems.
- Tools for efficient data transfer and management of large geospatial files.
- Integration with RCC's data management policies and best practices.
- Geocoding services available at [geocoder.rcc.uchicago.edu](https://geocoder.rcc.uchicago.edu) and [instructions](./geocoding.md).

## Research Examples

- Climate modeling with high-resolution geospatial data
- Urban planning simulations using parallel processing
- Large-scale ecological analyses across multiple geographic regions
