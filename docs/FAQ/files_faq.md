??? question "How much storage space do I have?"
    
    Use the quota command to get a summary of your current file system usage and available storage space


??? question "How do I get my storage quota increased?"

    Additional storage space can be purchased through the Cluster Partnership Program. You may also request additional storage as part of a Research II Allocation or Special Allocation.

??? question "How do I share files with others?"
    The recommended way to share files with members of your group is to store them in the /project or /project2 directory for your group. Project directories are created for all PI and project accounts. File and directory permissions can be customized to allow access to users within the group, as well as RCC users that do not belong to your group.

??? question "I accidentally deleted or lost a file. How do I restore it?"
    The best way to recover a recently deleted, corrupted or lost file is from a snapshot. See Data Recovery and Backups for more information.

??? question "How do I request a restore of my files from tape backup?"
    The RCC maintains tape backups of all home and project directories. These tape backups are intended for disaster recovery purposes only. There is no long-term history of files on tape. In most cases, you should use file system snapshots to retrieve recover files. See Data Recovery and Backups for more information.
