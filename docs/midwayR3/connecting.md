## Quick Overview:
Because MidwayR3 has no connection to the Internet, accessing MidwayR3 is a two-step process where you first connect to the Secure Data Enclave (SDE) Desktop using the Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) client and then log into MidwayR3.<br><br>

* You do not need to be connected to the University VPN before connecting to MidwayR. Azure takes care of encrypting and securing all communications between your local computer and the Virtual Desktop.
* You can connect from your web browser, in addition to the Microsoft Remote Desktop application.
* It is not possible to copy/paste between your local computer and the Virtual Desktop. However, you can still copy/paste from within the AVD environment.


## Connecting To SDE Desktop 
### Using Web Browser
Navigate to [https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient) on your computer's web browser.
Select "AVD Host" to launch the Virtual Desktop:

### Using ThinLinc

ThinLinc is a remote desktop server application. It is recommended to
use ThinLinc when you run software that requires a graphical user
interface, or "GUI" (e.g., Stata, MATLAB). To use ThinLinc to connect
to MidwayR3, please take the following steps on the SDE desktop:

1. Open a browser (Chrome or Firefox) and enter
   `https://sde.rcc.uchicago.edu` in the address bar.

2. Enter your CNetID and password on the ThinLinc login page:<br><br>

<br><br>

3. Follow the two-factor authentication prompts:<br><br>

<br><br>

4. If the login process is successful, you will see a Linux desktop environment. To access the command-line shell, select the Applications menu, then the Terminal icon:<br><br>

<br><br>

5. After selecting the Terminal icon, you should see a Terminal window appear. Typically this will give a console prompt showing which login node you are connected to:<br><br>

To exit ThinLinc, type `exit` in any Terminal window, select the top-right icon, then select the "Log Out" menu item and follow the instructions. Finally, close the browser window.<br><br>
