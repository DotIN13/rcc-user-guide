# MidwayR3 User Guide

The user guide will be built using
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). The `mkdocs` package is available on
the `python/3.7.0` module on Midway2. Please see the
[Getting Started](https://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started) section on
the MkDocs website on how you can render the files locally. You may
also use
[this page](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs) to
learn about different features of MkDocs.

## Instructions

Once you have installed MkDocs, it is easy to render the webpages and
view them:

```bash
cd midwayr/userguide
mkdocs serve
```

Once the MkDocs website has launched, it should provide you with an IP
address you can enter into your favourite browser.
