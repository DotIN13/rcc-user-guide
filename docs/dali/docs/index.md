# Welcome to DaLi user guide

The Data Lifecycle Instrument (DaLI) enables management and sharing of data from instruments and observations, allowing researchers to:

1.	acquire, transfer, process, and store data from experiments and observations in a unified workflow.
2.	manage data collections over their entire lifecycle.
3.	share and publish data.
4.	enhance outreach and education opportunities.

If you have any questions about DaLi, please send an email to rt@rcc.uchicago.edu.
