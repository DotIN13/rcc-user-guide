# R

[R](https://cran.r-project.org) has become an important tool for
quantitative research and data analysis in many fields.

See [this tutorial](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/R-large-scale) for
step-by-step instructions on how to set up and use R effectively on
midway2. This tutorial should also be easily transferrable to midway3
as R is set up similarly on midway3.

To find the list of currently available R modules, run:

```default
module avail R
```

The RStudio IDE is also available as `rstudio` modules:

```default
module avail rstudio
```

When using RStudio, we recommend connecting to the RCC cluster via
ThinLinc.
